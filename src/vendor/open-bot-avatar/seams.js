/**
 * Silhouette seams: small accidental steps where parts meet.
 *
 * The outer profile of the whole body (its left, right, top and bottom
 * extent, scanned every 0.1 units) should change either gradually (a smooth,
 * blended join) or by a clearly readable step. A sudden change of only a
 * fraction of a unit up to ~2.5 units is the in-between case: two parts whose
 * edges nearly line up leave a thin ledge or a notch at the join, which reads
 * as a flaw (and, magnified on a large stage, as a chip in the outline).
 *
 * A step's size is its whole same-direction change around the sudden part, so
 * a deliberate step with rounded corners still counts at its full height.
 * Changes touching the start or end of a profile run (a part's own rounded
 * top, say) are not joins and are skipped.
